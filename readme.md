Project Euler via NARS
======================

Synopsis
--------

My exploration of the [Project Euler][1] problem space via [NARS][2].

This is from 2012.

N.b.
----

These files need to be viewed from within NARS. They are plain text, but they
have lots of markup. And NARS uses a workspace idiom rather than a file idiom.
